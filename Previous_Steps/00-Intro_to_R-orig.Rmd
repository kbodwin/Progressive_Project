For now, you can ignore this bit:

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, error = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

There are two special things about R Markdown:

#### 1. Rendered documents

The way you see your text in the *source file* is not the way you see your text in the _rendered document_.

To see this, click the "Knit" button at the top of this window.

What does each of these special symbols do to text when it gets rendered? **Fill in the list below:**

* Hashtag, `##`:

* One asterisk `*` or one underscore `_`:

* Two asterisks `**` or two underscores `__`:


There are many more special symbols for formatting, but you shouldn't need more than these.

#### 2. Embedded code

In an R Markdown document, ordinary text can be interspersed with code.

You can embed and run an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
2+2
```

To make a new chunk, you can:

* Copy-paste an old chunk and change the code.

* Click the "+C" drop-down at the top of this window.

* Type "Ctrl-Alt-I"

* Manually type out the tick marks and `{r}` part.  (NOT RECOMMENDED)

To run the code in the chunk before you render the document,

* Click the green "play" button on the right.

* Use the "Run" drop-down menu at the top of this window.

* Highlight the code you want to run and type "Ctrl-Enter" (PC) or "Cmd-Enter" (Mac)


## Combining everything into a nice document

When you create your project steps each week, you'll want to make good use of the source file formatting and chunks to create a readable document.

What's great about R Markdown is that you can mix and match things like plots and corresponding discussions:

```{r}
plot(pressure)
```

Wow, it looks like the pressure is increasing over time!

Here is a chunk that is almost identical, but not quite:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Knit this document.  What is different about this chunk compared to the one before?

## Coding: What is permanent?

When you are using R to analyze data, you want to ask yourself:  Am I doing a **single computation**, or am I making a **permanent change** to an object, or am I creating a **new object**?

A lot of the time, we just want to do a calculation and see the result:

```{r}
## What is 1+2?

1 + 2

## What information is contained in the built-in "mtcars" dataset?

head(mtcars)
summary(mtcars)
```


Sometimes, we want to store a result to use it later:

```{r}
## What is 1+2?

a <- 1 + 2

## What information is contained in the built-in "mtcars" dataset?

first_car <- mtcars[1,]

## What is the KILOMETERS per gallon of each car?

mtcars %>%
  mutate(
    kpg = mpg*2.2
  )
```

Notice that nothing printed out.  When you ran this chunk, what happened in the *Environment* section of your screen?

We can now use these objects later.

```{r}
first_car

a + 5
```


Sometimes, we want to make a change to an object that already exists:

```{r}
## What is 1+2+5?

a <- a + 5

## What is the KILOMETERS per gallon of each car?

mtcars <- mtcars %>%
  mutate(
    kpg = mpg*2.2
  )

head(mtcars)
```


As you are working with datasets, you will sometimes want to do "temporary" tasks, such as:

* Computing a summary statistic

* Making a plot

* Performing a statistical test

In these cases, there's no real need to store your results in an object.

However, you will sometimes want to do "permanent" tasks, like:

* Narrow your dataset down to an area of focus

* Make new variables for your dataset

* Change existing variables in your dataset

In these cases, you'll want to make sure to use the `<-` part of the code to *reassign* your changed dataset and make the changes permanent.

(Note: By "permanent", I mean that within this R Markdown document, the changes will stay.  You are **not** altering the actual data file; only R's current understanding of the data.)
